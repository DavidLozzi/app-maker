## Theme Customization

This project uses Material-UI for the frontend design. The theme is customized in `src/theme.js` to match the application's color scheme: deep calm purple, light grey, and soft green.

## Responsive Design

For responsive design, adjustments are made using CSS in `public/responsive.css` and utility functions in `src/utils/responsiveDesign.js` to ensure the application adheres to a mobile-first approach.
